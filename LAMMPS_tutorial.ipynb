    "LAMMPS stands for \"Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator\". It is a powerful, open-source code for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. It is maintained and distributed by the Sandia National Laboratories, in the USA: https://lammps.sandia.gov/\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time to browse through the LAMMPS web site. Start from the \"Pictures\" and \"Movies\" sections: hopefully this will stimulate your appetite for MD simulations. Afterwards, take a look also at the other sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to the on-line **MANUAL**: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html. Notes:\n",
    "* LAMMPS is very powerful, and as a result the manual is very large (the pdf version is > 2000 pages!). It can be daunting on first approach, but don't be scared! We will start from the simplest, most basic features.\n",
    "* The on-line version of the manual documents the latest version of the code, which might not coincide with the version installed on your computer. A pdf version on the manual corresponding to your LAMMPS version is available inside the \"Doc\" subdirectory of the installation, on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have become familiar with the general structure of LAMMPS inputs, you may also use **Google**. For example, searching \"LAMMPS fix NVT\" should lead directly to the relevant page of the manual.\n",

    "```\n",
    "%> lmp_serial\n",
    "```\n",
    "(the program will complain that there is no input: don't worry about it!). Make a note of the directory on the computer where LAMMPS has been installed. In my case it is  `C:\\Program Files\\LAMMPS 64-bit 7Dec2018`. This will contain a few sub-directories:\n",
    "* `bin` for the (binary) executables. Your computer's `PATH` variable should point to this directory;\n",
    "* `Doc` for the documentation (manuals);\n",
    "* `Examples` and `Benchmarks` for input/output examples (the benchmarks are computationally demanding examples);\n",
    "* `Potentials` and `frc_files` for files with parameters for interatomic potentials and force fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the full LAMMPS distribution, which includes the source code, has some additional directories. You might want to download and compile it later. The pre-built version of the code does not include all the features described on the manual, but only a selection of the most popular ones. "

    "1.  One important difference between this and the previous calculation is that here were are effectively simulating \"bulk\" system, instead of a discrete cluster. This is possible thanks to the use of the \"three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions\":  https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/boundary.html\n",
    "2. We are using \"real\" units, instead of Lennard-Jones units:  https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/units.html\n",
    "3. Since we are using \"real\" units, we must specify \"real\" values for the properties of the atoms which we are simulating. We are using the parameters appropriate for Argon.\n",
    "4. The trajectories (i.e., atomic coordinates and other information) generated during an MD simulation can be stored or \"dumped\" to a file in a variety of different formats: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dump.html. The ```*.lammpstrj``` file can be visualized with VMD, like an ```*.xyz```. But, in order to do so, the ```*.lammpstrj.gz``` must be decompressed first:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%> gzip -d LJ_dynamics.lammpstrj.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. The number of timesteps which are simulated is determined by the last line of the input (```run 10000```). Each timestep corresponds to 2.0 fs (```timestep 2```). A very important line, which determines how the system evolves during each timestep, is the one in between (```fix 1 all nve```).  In LAMMPS, a “fix” is any operation that is applied to the system during timestepping or minimization. Examples include updating of atom positions and velocities due to time integration, controlling temperature, applying constraint forces to atoms, enforcing boundary conditions, computing diagnostics, etc. There are hundreds of fixes defined in LAMMPS and new ones can be added. See here: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix.html. **The fix command is very important within LAMMPS.** Try to read it carefully and understand it. You may need to go back and re-read it after some time, as your understanding of LAMMPS and MD simulations increase."

    "We shall now perform a more elaborate simulation. We want to perform an MD simulation of the liquid at the experimental triple point temperature and density: https://lar.bnl.gov/properties/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to compute the pressure and the Ar-Ar pair distribution function, and compare it to experiment. These comparisons will allow us to judge the quality of the Lennard-Jones potential used to model Argon. We also want to use the simulations to test the equipartition theorem Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations are performed in the NVT ensemble. The system's energy is no longer contant, as we imagine that it is in \"contact\" with a thermostat at a temperature $T$. To model the exchange of energy with this (fictitious) heat bath, we modify Newton's equations of motion by adding to the conservative forces ($-\\nabla_i V$) a frictional (drag) force and a stochastic (random) force:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "m_i \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = - \\nabla_i V({\\mathbf{r}_1,...,\\mathbf{r}_N}) - \\zeta_i\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i + \\mathbf{X}_i(t) \\, .\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This approach is known as [Langevin dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_dynamics). It is usually employed to model the [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) of colloidal particles but, with the right set of parameters, it can be used also to describe the \"almost Newtonian\" dynamics of the individual atoms within an NVT MD simulation.\n",
    "In the Langevin equation, the term $\\mathbf{X}_i(t)$ represents a random force, whose fluctuations obey the following statistical properties:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\left\\langle X_{i,\\alpha}(t) \\right\\rangle &=& 0 \\hspace{1cm} (\\alpha, \\beta=x,y,z) \\\\\n",
    "\\left\\langle X_{i,\\alpha}(t) X_{j,\\beta}(t') \\right\\rangle &=& 2 \\zeta_i k_BT \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta} \\delta(t-t') \\, .\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "The first equation simply says that the average components of the force should be zero. The second equation says that there should be no correlation between different components of the force ($\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}$), no correlation between its values at different particles ($\\delta_{ij}$), no correlation between its values at different times [$\\delta(t-t')$]. Finally, the mean-square value of the force should be proportional to the absolute temperature $T$ and to the friction coefficient $\\zeta_i$, which appears within the drag term of the Langevin equation. It could be shown that, if these conditions are satisfied, the average kinetic energy of the particle satisfies the equipartition theorem for the target temperature (i.e., the system is thermostatted correctly):\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2} m_i \\left\\langle \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_i^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{3}{2}k_BT \\, .\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "\n",
    "* A popular coarse-grained model for polymer chains is the one proposed by [Kremer and Grest]( https://doi.org/10.1063/1.458541) in the 1990's. It is a bead-and-spring model, where the \"beads\" interact by purely repulsive WCA potentials and the \"springs\" connecting them are represented by non-linear [FENE](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/bond_fene.html) bonds. Variants of the model have been  to simulate entanglements in polymer melts, rubber networks, nanocomposites, polymers in thin films, polymer glasses, etc.. See also [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03509) for its adapatation to model specific commodity polymers. Find out how to use it in LAMMPS to model polymer melts of different lengths, and extract some interesting quantities (e.g., the chains' diffusion coefficients and radii of gyration). An executable distributed with LAMMPS ([chain.exe](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Tools.html#chain)) can be used to generate reasonable initial \"random coil\" configurations for the chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [Embedded-Atom Model](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_eam.html) (EAM) can be used to simulate metals, both in the solid state (with non-directional bonding forces, as in those FFC/CCP structures) and in the liquid state. Look for the EAM parameter files for a element of your choice, find out how to them within LAMMPS and perform simulations with it. See also https://openkim.org/ and https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/, to find out which potentials are available for which elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to lack of time we could not illustrate the use of \"many-body\" and \"reactive\" force fields. A prototype of such force fields is the Stillinger-Weber potential, which was originally developed in the 1980's to perform MD simulations of solid and liquid Silicon.\n",
    "See here: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/entry/1985--Stillinger-F-H-Weber-T-A--Si/ and the LAMMPS documentation https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_sw.html. Later, the same potential was re-parametrized to model also other elements (e.g. Carbon) and even water (see [Water Modeled As an Intermediate Element between Carbon and Silicon](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp805227c)). This is a link to another molecular modeling course, which contains an \"exercise\" for the students invoving the SW potential (using another program): http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~cfa22/msim/node41.html.

    "LAMMPS is a powerful and complex code, with many fancy features. However, it can also be frustrating to use for a novice. It takes time to appreciate how it works. Each input file is like a computer program, which should be tested and debugged. If you are trying to write your own LAMMPS input, do *not* do it all in one go. Start by writing a few lines, and run LAMMPS for a few time steps to test them. Look carefully at the output. Visualize also the trajectory with VMD or another visualization program. Correct your input, if the program does not behave as expected. Add a few more lines, and test them. And so on and so forth, until the program is complete. Only then, after you are sure that it is also correct, run the full simulation. Be patient, and enjoy!"
